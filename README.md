## 🚧 Updates and Roadmap of the Project


### Update V1.0.1 - The Day 1 Update

* (Done) Could only add two people to the file
* (Done) Function `delete_file`: was deleting the file even when saying no
* (Done) Fucntion 'show_info': cant read the file when the program was just launched, even if the file has content

### Update V1.0.2 - Searching 'n Looking (30/10/2025)

* (done) Function `find_info` in the works (bool type used in the wrong way)

### Update V1.0.3 - Rearrange it (November 2025)

* Will be using a struct array to store people in memory before writing them to the file (for every function)

### Update V1.1 - Overhaul of the Project - 2nd edition (December 2025)

* (IMPORTANT) Export a csv file at the end of the program and, throughout the program, export a bin file to store the data efficiently
  * To have a user friendly version of the database for user
  * To have a efficient/fast way to load data
* Be able to edit a person's informations
* Be able to delete one specific person
* Be able to show the data by parameters (income, weight, height, etc)
* Be able to verify the format of the data: emails with '@', phone numbers with actually numbers (based on french phone numbers), forces float arguments to only have two decimals

### Update V2 - A Cool Local Interface (January 2026)

* Using Raylib 5.0 to completely change the looks for the project
